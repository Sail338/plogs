# How to Contribute
If you are looking to contribute to Pretty Logs, I tried my best to make local development and testing as easy
as possible. If you've worked on Python projects before, a lot of these steps should feel familiar, and if not,
don't worry - I give in-depth explanations about each step.

### Download Plogs
If you are looking to edit any of the code, the first thing you need to do is to clone the repository. The easiest way
to do that is by running the following command in a terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/11/plogs.git
```

If you are new to using a terminal, you can also download the project by clicking: `Download Zip`.


### Creating a Virtual Environment
Creating a virtual environment is a key part to development. With virtual environments, you can ensure you are developing
with the correct version of python, isolate installed python packages to just a single directory, as well as avoid
a lot of conflicts with your system version of python.

To create a virtual environment, we need to install `python-virtualenv` with `pip`. If you don't already have `pip`
installed, take a look the proper way to install `pip` on your type of machine:

    - Windows:
    - Mac:
    - Debian:
    - Arch:
